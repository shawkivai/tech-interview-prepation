## System Design

In this section, we dive deep into system design concepts that are frequently asked in senior-level interviews. Topics include scalability, high availability, and distributed systems.

### Key Topics
- Load Balancers and Reverse Proxies
- Microservices Architecture
- Caching Strategies (Redis, Memcached)
- Database Sharding and Replication
- Scalability and Fault Tolerance

### Suggested Resources

## Design Patterns

Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common software design problems. This section focuses on the most frequently asked patterns in interviews, particularly for Senior Software Engineer roles.

### Key Patterns
- Singleton
- Factory
- Observer
- Dependency Injection
- Strategy

## Design Principles

Understand and apply solid design principles to create scalable and maintainable code. These are often tested in senior technical interviews.

### Principles to Study
- SOLID Principles
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)
